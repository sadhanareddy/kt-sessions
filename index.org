* Introduction
  The document describes building a *College Cloud Edition* for
  virtual-labs.

  Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition is the Portable-Edition for
  Virtual Labs. It offers the offline version of Virtual labs,
  experiments and theoretical content. This edition addresses the lack
  of internet access or poor internet connectivity across different
  institutes/colleges. It results in a very cost-effective Learning
  Management System.

** Objective 
   Build the Portable-Edition on HDD and make it portable. The
   portable media can be used for accessing the labs from local
   machine (no need of internet connection).
